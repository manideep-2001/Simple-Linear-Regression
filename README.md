 # Linear Regression   
A car showroom named "Hyundai vehicles" has some predefined information, such as the brand names, the model, the year of registration, the price, the fuel type, the type of vehicle, etc. To build an automated prediction model for automobiles, a data scientist gathered data from Hyundai cars, cleaned it up, preprocessed it, and then built the model.

A Data scientist performs the following major tasks(the process of building a model)
Data collection: It is a process of collecting relevant data for a problem statement.
Data cleaning: This is a process of removing unwanted, and irrelevant data.
Data pre-processing: It is a process that involves transforming raw data into well-formed datasets.
Model building(choose the appropriate model).

# About the dataset

The dataset contains 10000 entries and 11 columns such as Brand name, Model name, year of registration, Price, fuel type, vehicle type, gearbox, PowerPS, etc
price: the value of vehicle, 
name: name of the vehicle,
yearOfRegistration: Vehicle registration year,
monthOfRegistration: Vehicle registration month,
gearbox: Types of vehicle gearbox(manuell, automatik),
powerPS: the power of the vehicle (Torque), 
model: Model name of the vehicle,
kilometer: kilometers driven,
fuelType: Fuel type of the vehicle,
brand: Make of the vehicle(Brand Names),
vehicleType: Type of the vehicle.  

# Expected outcomes:

Import the packages and classes that you need.
Provide data to work with, and eventually do appropriate transformations(find out the best way to fill the missing values).
Complete any other preprocessing required.
Apply different Outlier detection methods and choose the best approach to treat outliers.
Create various regression models and fit them with existing data.
Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory.
Apply Variance Inflation Factors calculation and find if the model built has collinearity between different variables.
